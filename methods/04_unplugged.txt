SILENT STUDENT SORTING UNPLUGGED
*BACKGROUND*
This activity is best done right before a sorting unit to build the concept.

*PRE-REQUISITES*
Can work with no prior knowledge

*DIFFERENTIATION*
an aspect of this activity well-suited to tiering / scaffolding / differentiation
Assign select number of students as activity drivers allows students to observe 
process of activity and benefit from all information 

*GROUPING*
Randomized whole group activity (entire class)

*STUDENT PREP*
show an example of a mini-sort (limited to a few items)
for example - first 3 holidays in a calendar year
etc

*DIRECTION ACTIVITIES*
1) Identify the rules:
  - No talking or writing
  - Line up alphabetically by last name (A to the left, Z to the right)
  - If same last name, sort by first name
  - Everyone raises a hand when completed (signals end of sort)
2) Ask for any clarifying questions
3) Let chaos reign
4) After activity, debrief:
  - What strategies did you see a peer use to solve this problem?
  - If you were to do this activity again, what would you do differently?
5) Run the activity again with a different sorting condition, like:
  - Birthday (month then day, no year)
  - OSIS (good for intuitively working with arrays)

*emphasis on chaos
*multiple attempts
