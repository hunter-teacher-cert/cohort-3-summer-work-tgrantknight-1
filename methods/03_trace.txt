CODE TRACING in the classroom
======================================


PROS:
---------------------------------------
<general positive aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
1. Code tracing allows students to visualize computational processes that might be otherwise hidden or difficult to conceputalize.

2.Shows the logical steps of how the program operates and how the order of the steps as the program is running.

3. Allows for multiple avenues of scaffolding and differentiation that might not be visiable during actual programming. 

CONS:
---------------------------------------
<general negative aspects of incorporating code or algorithm tracing into a CS course, from your perspective>
1. If not exectued well, students might get discouraged and shut down. 

BEST FOR:
---------------------------------------
<types of activities from courses you teach or have taught that could benefit from an emphasis on tracing>
1. Testing short iterations.
2. Refering back to stored variables in complex code.

LEAST-SUITED TO:
---------------------------------------
<opposite of above -- and why>
1. Possibly younger students who might not fully understand the rational for trace diagrams.
2. Complex problems for populations that are struggling or easily overwhelmed. 

PROVEN PRO-TIPS:
---------------------------------------
<
 anything that has worked well for any member of your team, in the way of ...
 * live tracing ("trace-along" a la livecoding)
 * tracing as an assignment
 * tools, physical/online/otherwise that make it easier/clearer
 * etc 
>
1. Multiple color markers / ink / text.
2. Group-editable documents. 
3. Organized writing / set up of the stack diagram.
4. Pre-made sheets / diagrams.
