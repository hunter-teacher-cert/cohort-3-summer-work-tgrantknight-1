7/5/22 Topic: 2D Arrays

Consider using integer division for arrays when you only need to use the first half (up to and not including the middle)

For 2D Arrays, here is the notation for getting rows and cols:

int rows = array.length; // Use i
int cols = array[0].length; // Use j

"Jagged array" means a 2D array with different col values
