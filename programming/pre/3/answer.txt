1. The output of this code is:
      No, I wug.You wugga wug.I wug.

2. There are no variables in this program, so a stack diagram doesn't quite work.
   However, the current output when ping() is first invoked is:
      No, I wug.You wugga wug

3. If you invoke baffle(); at the end of ping, you would get:
      No, I wug.You wugga wug.wug.wug.wug. ...

      Where the substring "wug." would repeat forever, creating an infinite loop.
