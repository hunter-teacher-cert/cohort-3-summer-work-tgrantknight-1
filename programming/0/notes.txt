- Fixed issue with GitHub repository
- New class GitHub:
https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/cohort-3-summer-work-tgrantknight-1

Added input.nextLine(); to Time.class

picking variable names for scanners, use *input* not *in* (which is what the book uses)

ex of constants:

final int SEC_IN_MIN = 60;

note the use of final and all caps, constants do not use camelCase.

integer division doesn't *round*, it uses the *floor*

example of a single line if statement with some wild stuff:

s = (--beers == 1)?"":"s";

--beers subtract 1 first from beers
(--beers == 1) is the condition
? ends the if part
"" is the true part
: starts the else
"s"
