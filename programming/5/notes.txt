Java constructors set default values if constructor parameters aren't present.

Ex:

constructor signature:
public Grade (String id, double s, double w) {

}

calling it:
Grade g = new Grade(); // <- id, s, w not needed,
// so id defaults to "", s to 0.0, w to 0.0

But you could also do;
Grade g = new Grade("BACON", 90.0, 0.5);

would also work.

private class attributes means that you can't access them directly from outside of the class.

So this won't work:
private int a
class instance called w

w.a has an error.
