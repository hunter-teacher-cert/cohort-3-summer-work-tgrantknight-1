ArrayList<type> is the data structure I saw on AP CS A problems
- this has methods like .add() already built in

ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>(); // can do (3) for length 3
.add(String value) -> adds a string to the end of the ArrayList
.add(int index, String value) -> inserts value into index and shift everything right
.set(int index, String value) -> replaces the index with the value
.size() -> number of elements in ArrayList

*** Everything you put into an ArrayList has to be an object

so CANNOT: ArrayList<int>, INSTEAD: ArrayList<Integer>
Integer is the wrapper class for int

Term "idiom" for the common coding blocks
like the traversal code, or the swapping elements code

Linked lists: elements know themselves and who is after
